                <p class="text-justify">
                    The academic and professional career of Dr Lawrence Ma was marked by his contributions to the great socioeconomic digital transformation of the early 21st century and leading from the cutting edge of applied cryptography and blockchain technology.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    He was the inspiration for countless young students and professionals, providing a positive influence and persuading many to pursue a career in computer science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Throughout his life, whether working in academia or industry, Dr. Ma was on a lifelong mission to search for the hidden gifted talents. With sky-high standards, Dr. Ma may not have considered his mission a success, but he has successfully made an impact on over 10,000 secondary and tertiary students through the teaching of industry knowledge across a plethora of topics, including the most cutting edge of AI, machine learning, blockchain, cryptography, data analysis, and financial engineering. His teachings helped hundreds of students secure positions in professional firms and PhD programmes around the world.
                </p>
                <h1>Early Years</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence Ma Kwan Ho (馬君豪) was born on 29 May 1962 in British Hong Kong and was brought up in a loving family atmosphere that supported his pursuits in science and mathematics. Lawrence received his primary education at the Diocesan Boys' School in Kadoorie Hill, near Mong Kok and Ho Man Tin. Lawrence gained a reputation for a penchant for learning among his teachers.
                </p>
                <img src="img/lawrence-ma-younger.png" style="width:80%; margin:40px auto 0;display:block;" alt="Lawrence Ma (left) in his younger, wilder years." />
                <p class="caption textblack">Lawrence Ma (left) in his younger, wilder years.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence attended secondary school with the future Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hon. John Lee Ka-chiu, at the Wah Yan College (Kowloon) in Yau Ma Tei, near Mong Kok and Ho Man Tin. Lawrence explored his interests in natural sciences, especially in chemistry. Lawrence completed his secondary education at The Lawrenceville School, located at the Lawrence Township, in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States of America. However, in choosing a career, Lawrence decided to embark on the path of math, reasoning that thought experiments would be markedly less dangerous than lab experiments.
                </p>
                <h1>On the Path of Math</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence entered Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, USA in 1980, taking classes with the future founder of the Julia programming language, Dr. Prof. Alan Edelman. Lawrence earned his Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1984 and decided to continue studying mathematics at Stanford University in Santa Clara, California, USA. Lawrence earn his Masters in Mathematics in 1986.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence continued to study mathematics at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, USA. In 1993, Lawrence earned his mathematics PhD with the dissertation: Quasisymmetric Conjugacy of Degree N Critical Circle Map, advised by John Hamal Hubbard. Upon completing his PhD, the National University of Singapore invited Lawrence to teach mathematics. Academic life was however not his cup of tea and Lawrence was analyzing other opportunities.
                </p>
                <h1>From Theory to Application</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In 1998, Lawrence successfully escaped from the gravity well of academia and began his lifelong impact in applied mathematics, starting with quantitative finance, the use of mathematical models and extremely large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities. It is a highly rewarding career with finance and intellectual fulfillment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    His first role in industry is the Head of Quantitative Research at Man Drapeau Research, a Singapore-based joint venture of Man Drapeau Group (MDG) between Man Investment Products (UK) and Drapeau Advisors (US). Lawrence managed a crack team of finance engineers in devising risk management and portfolio strategies for the (US)$300 million dollars under management. The portfolio traded global financial and commodity futures and US stocks.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence then joined the American Bourses Corporation (ABC), a spin-off co of the MDG. Lawrence held two roles: as Senior Vice President, he was responsible for business development of both online and offline financial solutions and financial services in North Asia; as the Global Head of Research and Development in Financial Engineering, he continued his previous role leading a team of quants in developing AI and trading for institutional & retail clients via the electronic communication networks.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    After being in Singapore for a decade, Lawrence left for the booming economy of Mainland China and co-founded the Orbrich (China) International Factors, the country’s first government-approved independent international factoring company in the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA). As the director with a technical background, Lawrence was instrumental in the factoring operation, credit decision and monitoring process. Lawrence also lead the technology development division to build a proprietary factoring risk management system. During this time, Lawrence was also a Senior Advisor at Bain & Company out of nearby Beijing, advising on the Bank of China’s internal market model project.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    After nearly a decade in the Mainland of China, Lawrence returned to his hometown Hong Kong to become the CEO of Fortel Solutions Limited. Lawrence spent this time studying the cutting edge of technology, especially machine learning and blockchain. During this time, he met his most influential partner and life-long friend Peter Woo, a fellow former academic turned industry professional with a penchant for cutting edge technology applications. Little did they both realize that this bromance would blossom into an enterprise blockchain community spanning the globe.
                </p>
                <h1>Journey into Deep Tech, Cryptography, Privacy, and Identity</h1>

                <p class="caption textblack">Lawrence Ma (left) and Peter Woo at the founding of EMALI in 2016.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    One day, Lawrence called Peter and said, “it’s time.” It was late 2016, about eight years after the debut of bitcoin and the blockchain technology running it. What Lawrence was referring to was that it was time to start thinking about blockchain technology applications. Together with a crack team of students and associates, Lawrence and his team submitted several submissions to the 2017 AIA Blockchain Challenge in January, with the intention of seeing where they stood under the scrutiny of industry professionals. To their pleasant surprise, they were among the Top Five Winners in the Professional Category and were the top two Student Category projects. Lawrence and Peter’s group had entered as “EMALI” and the name stuck.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    EMALI was formally incorporated as a company and admitted into the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park’s Incu-Tech Programme in April 2017. Lawrence’s team at EMALI began working on various fintech software and solutions specializing in identity, banking, insurance claims, fraud detection and regulatory registries and it didn’t take long to start receiving honours. Their achievements included being a finalist at DIT Hong Kong FinTech Awards 2017 (launched by Department for International Trade), Zurich Innovation World Championship Regional Winner (HK) in 2018, and being awarded the Best Digital Identity Solution at the Global Trade Technology Challenge in 2020.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Ever passionate about expanding the enterprise blockchain scene in Hong Kong and increasing the number of students interested in STEM, and in blockchain technology in particular, Lawrence and Peter founded the Hong Kong Blockchain Society (HKBCS) in November 2016. HKBCS had two clear missions; setting professional standards in blockchain and accelerating advancement and adoption of blockchain technology. To this end, HKBCS brought together a group of technical enthusiasts who strongly believed in the power of enterprise blockchain and wanted to spread that passion to the Hong Kong community and ecosystem. HKBCS kickstarted the community by offering certified training for R3 Corda.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    During his time as President, a role Lawrence held until his death, HKBCS has worked with every major sector of industry and government since 2016, including Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), MIT Julia Lab, Deloitte, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). With his guidance, it has also become the only mature professional association for blockchain technology in Hong Kong SAR, being solely able to provide training, certification, and advisory assistance to the nascent blockchain industry in the Mainland of China.

                <p class="caption textblack">Lawrence Ma (third from right) at the Blockchain Demo Day and Olympiad Preparation Day at Diocesan Girl’s School in 2021.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence has always been interested in teaching, and for quite a long time, he was engaged in blockchain education at Hong Kong Baptist University. He enjoys the sense of achievement that teaching brings him. He believes that teaching is his mission. It is his lifelong pursuit to help more people have access to and learn blockchain knowledge and apply it to reality. He believes that the ultimate goal of learning is to apply what one has learned.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    With Lawrence and Peter at the helm, HKBCS has trained and educated over 10,000 students and professionals in the field of blockchain technology. HKBCS has received funding from HSBC and the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong SAR Government, to provide blockchain courses to secondary and tertiary students in local schools. HKBCS also serves as an official training partner for the International Blockchain Olympiad in Hong Kong, a pioneering annual blockchain solution design competition for students and fresh graduates. Lawrence has also been closely involved with Fintech Olympiad, a training course in the crafting of financial technology solutions, with an emphasis on machine learning and blockchain solutions, for all university students in the Greater Bay Area.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    On the rare occasions Lawrence had free time, he loved to travel Hong Kong in search of delicious food and drink. Lawrence is well-known for knowing exactly where to go and exactly what to order.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Lawrence was a huge force in pushing blockchain technology into wide acceptance and his knowledge, enthusiasm, and gentle hand will be missed. He is survived by his brother and his mother.
