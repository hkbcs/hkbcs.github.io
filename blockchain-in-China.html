                Translator’s note: It is not a coincidence that Xi gives out this speech right after
                Zuckerberg’s testimony at the Congress. The speech also changed many people’s view on the market
                for the next few weeks. In my own opinion, it is very crucial for someone to make market
                judgment by reading the original text (rather than hearing from some interpretations).
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, from an undisclosed source, Alipay and WeChat have been running a few projects trying
                to push out a cryptocurrency solution embedded in their current platforms under the guidance of
                the Central Bank. These projects are all competitive to each other and the leaders (Central
                Bank, Alipay and WeChat Pay) will determine which approach will be finally adopted as time goes
                by.

                    Xi
                    mentioned about regulation and laws at the last part of the speech set the tone that the country
                    largely
                    encourages more experiments and exploration rather than enforcing strict regulation)

                Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, at the study emphasized that the integrated
                application of blockchain technology plays an important role in new technological innovation and
                industrial transformation. “We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent
                innovation of core technologies, <b>evaluate the right approach to deploy our resources, increase
                    investment, focus on a number of key core technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain
                    technology and industrial innovation</b>.”
                <br><br>

                Xi Jinping pointed out: “The application of blockchain technology has already extended to digital
                finance, Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, digital asset trading
                and other fields. At present, major countries in the world are accelerating the development of
                blockchain technology. China has a good foundation in the field of blockchain. <b>It is necessary to
                    accelerate the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation, and actively promote
                    the
                    development of blockchain and social-economic integration</b>.”
                <br><br>

                “It is necessary to strengthen basic research, enhance the original innovation ability, and strive to
                let China take the <b>leading position in the emerging field of blockchain, occupy the commanding
                    heights
                    of innovation, and gain new industrial advantages</b>. It is necessary to promote collaborative
                research,
                accelerate the breakthrough of core technologies, and provide safe and controllable technical support
                for the development of blockchain applications. It is necessary to <b>lead the standard setting and
                    right
                    to speak in the world</b>. It is necessary to speed up industrial development, give play to market
                advantages, and further open up the innovation chain, application chain and value chain. It is necessary
                to build an ecosystem of blockchain industry, accelerate the deep integration of blockchain with other
                frontier information technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and Internet of Things, and
                promote integrated applications. <b>It is necessary to strengthen the talent pool, build a variety of
                    talent training platforms, and cultivate a group of leaders and innovation teams</b>.”
                <br><br>

                “It is necessary to seize the opportunity of blockchain technology integration, function expansion and
                industry segmentation, and play the role of blockchain in promoting <b>data sharing, optimizing business
                    processes, reducing operating costs, improving synergy, and building a credit system</b>. It is
                necessary to
                promote the deep integration of the blockchain and the real economy, and solve the problems of
                difficulty in <b>financing loans for SMEs, difficulties in controlling the risks of banks</b>, and
                difficulties
                in departmental supervision. It is necessary to use blockchain technology to explore digital economic
                model innovation, provide power for creating a convenient, efficient, fair and competitive, stable and
                transparent business environment, and provide services for <b>promoting structural reforms on the
                    supply-side and realizing the effective matching of supply and demand in various industries</b>, in
                order to
                accelerate industrial evolution. Provide support for continuous transformation and promote high-quality
                economic development.”
                <br><br>

                “It is necessary to explore the application of ‘<b>blockchain+</b>’ in people’s daily life, and actively
                promote the application of blockchain technology in the fields of <b>education, employment, pension,

                services.
                It is necessary to promote the combination of the underlying technological services of blockchain and
                the construction of new smart cities, explore the application in the fields of information
                infrastructure, smart transportation, energy and power, and improve the level of intelligence of urban
                management. It is necessary to use blockchain technology to promote <b>greater inter-connectivity among
                    cities in terms of information, capital, talents, and credit information</b>, and ensure the
                resource-production efficiency within the region. It is necessary to explore the use of the
                <b>blockchain
                    data sharing model to achieve the joint maintenance and utilization of government data across
                    departments and regions</b>, promote business synergy, strengthen the <b>digital governmental

                <br><br>

                “It is necessary to <b>strengthen the guidance and regulation of blockchain technology, strengthen the
                    research and analysis of blockchain security risks, closely track development trends, and actively
                    explore laws</b>. It is necessary to explore the establishment of a safety guarantee system that
                adapts to
                the blockchain technology mechanism, and guide and promote blockchain developers and platform operators
                to strengthen industry self-discipline and take safety responsibilities. It is necessary to implement
                the rule of law into the management of blockchain and promote the safe and orderly development of
                blockchain.”
                <br><br>

                “Relevant departments and their respective leaders should pay attention to the status quo and trend of
                blockchain technology development, improve the application and management of blockchain technology
                capabilities, and enable blockchain technology to build a stronger network of things, develop digital
